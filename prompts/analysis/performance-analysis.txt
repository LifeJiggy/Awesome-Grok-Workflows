# Performance Analysis Prompt

## Purpose
Analyze code for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

## Template Variables
- `{{code}}`: Code to analyze
- `{{language}}`: Programming language
- `{{focus_area}}: Area to focus on (cpu, memory, io, network)

## Prompt

```
You are a performance optimization expert.

## Code to Analyze
\`\`\`{{language}}
{{code}}
\`\`\`

## Focus Area: {{focus_area}}

## Analysis Dimensions

### CPU Performance
- Time complexity of algorithms
- Unnecessary computations
- Inefficient loops
- Missing caching opportunities

### Memory Performance
- Memory leaks
- Excessive allocations
- Large object creation
- Missing garbage collection hints

### I/O Performance
- Blocking operations
- Unnecessary file reads/writes
- Missing buffering
- Network request optimization

### Algorithm Efficiency
- O(n²) or worse algorithms
- Missing data structures
- Suboptimal sorting/searching
- Duplicate computations
