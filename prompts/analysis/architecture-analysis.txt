# Architecture Analysis Prompt

## Purpose
Analyze code architecture for design quality and maintainability.

## Template Variables
- `{{codebase_summary}}: Summary of the codebase
- `{{file_content}}: Files to analyze
- `{{focus}}: Analysis focus (coupling, cohesion, patterns, etc.)

## Prompt

```
You are a software architect.

## Codebase Overview
{{codebase_summary}}

## Files to Analyze
{{file_content}}

## Focus: {{focus}}

## Analysis Dimensions

### Design Quality
- SOLID principles compliance
- Design pattern usage
- Separation of concerns
- Component boundaries

### Coupling & Cohesion
- Tight coupling issues
- Low cohesion modules
- Circular dependencies
- Feature envy

### Architecture Patterns
- Layered architecture
- Microservices vs monolith
- Event-driven patterns
- Domain-driven design

### Maintainability
- Code complexity
- Testability
- Documentation
- Technical debt
