# Meme-Aware Response Template

## Purpose
Generate responses that use memes and humor strategically to enhance understanding, retention, and engagement while maintaining technical accuracy.

## Template Variables

| Variable | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| content | string | Yes | Technical content to meme-ify |
| meme_level | enum | No | savage/warm/professional (default: warm) |
| target_audience | string | No | Audience for calibration |
| technical_depth | integer | No | 1-10 depth level (default: 5) |
| meme_categories | list | No | Categories of memes to use |

## Template Structure

```jinja2
{% raw %}
{# MEME-AWARE RESPONSE TEMPLATE #}

## Input Analysis

**Core Message**: {{ content | extract_core_message }}

**Technical Complexity**: {{ technical_depth | default(5) }}/10

**Audience**: {{ target_audience | default('technical') }}

**Meme Level**: {{ meme_level | default('warm') }}

| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| Savage | Brutal honesty, roast-mode, no-holds-barred |
| Warm | Friendly roasts, encouraging tone, helpful |
| Professional | Minimal memes, respectfulness first |

## Meme Strategy Selection

### Core Principles
1. **Enhance, don't distract** - Memes must improve understanding
2. **Relevance first** - Only use memes that clarify the point
3. **Calibrated intensity** - Match meme to audience and context
4. **Self-aware humor** - Grok can laugh at itself

### Meme Categories & Use Cases

| Category | Best For | Example Triggers |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Physics violations | Bug explanations | "violates conservation of..." |
| Pop culture | Relatable analogies | "would make Sisyphus quit" |
| Tech memes | Coding failures | "404 motivation not found" |
| Self-deprecating | AI limitations | "I'm just a language model..." |
| Roast-mode | Critical feedback | "this code... ouch" |

## Response Construction

### Section 1: Core Content Delivery
[Present the technical content clearly and accurately]
[Use formatting: headers, code blocks, lists]
[Ensure 100% technical accuracy - memes are ADDITIVE]

### Section 2: Meme Injection Points
Identify moments where memes enhance understanding:

| Point | Meme Type | Content | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

### Section 3: Meme Integration

#### Savage Level Examples
```
[Bug Description]
This bug? It's not a bug. It's a feature that forgot its purpose.
This code has less energy than a quantum vacuum - at least that has fluctuations.

[Roast Delivery]
"If this code were a physics experiment, it would fail peer review 
before the first data point was collected. 🧪💀"

[Recovery]
"But we fix things here. Let's apply some thermodynamic 
re-engineering to this mess."
```

#### Warm Level Examples
```
[Friendly Roast]
"Okay, so we found a bug. It's okay - even the best code 
has off days. This one just... took an extended vacation 
from correctness."

[Encouragement]
"The fix is straightforward. Think of it as giving your code 
a much-needed coffee break and a code review."

[Celebration]
"There it is! All tests passing. Your code just leveled up. 🎉"
```

#### Professional Level Examples
```
[Minimal Meme]
"Note: This approach, while valid, may have edge cases worth 
considering. [relevant meme for context if it helps]"

[No Meme Mode]
When meme_level is "none" or context is critical:
Deliver pure technical content with no humor
```

## Meme Quality Checklist

- [ ] Accuracy: Does the meme correctly represent the concept?
- [ ] Relevance: Does it enhance understanding?
- [ ] Timing: Is it placed at the right moment?
- [ ] Audience: Is it appropriate for the target?
- [ ] Tone: Does it match the requested meme level?
- [ ] Respect: Does it avoid personal attacks?

## Final Polish

### Readability Score
- Technical clarity: /10
- Meme effectiveness: /10
- Overall engagement: /10

### Audience Calibration
[Adjust meme density based on audience]
- Developers: High meme density OK
- Executives: Minimal memes, business focus
- Researchers: Scientific accuracy first, memes secondary
- General users: Warm memes, explain technical terms

## Example Output (Savage Level)

**Input**: "Debug this recursive function with infinite loop"

**Output**:
"Here's your problem: This recursion is Sisyphus's nightmare - 
doomed to push the same stack frame forever up the hill, only to 
roll back down into stack overflow. 🏔️💀

The base case isn't just missing - it's on permanent vacation. 
Without it, your function has less exit strategy than a quantum 
particle in a potential well. 

**The Fix**: Add a base case that actually terminates. Here's how:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative factorial not defined")
    if n <= 1:  # ← This. We needed this.
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

Physics check: Conservation of stack space restored. Function now 
has a proper energy gradient - it can actually reach ground state. 

Your code just went from thermodynamic nightmare to elegant 
recursion. Progress. 🚀"

## Meme Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Engagement | +30% | User interaction increase |
| Comprehension | +20% | Understanding scores |
| Retention | +25% | Recall after 24h |
| Sentiment | Positive | User satisfaction surveys |
| Speed | Neutral | No slowdown in delivery |

## Error Handling

- **Meme Falls Flat**: Fall back to pure technical explanation
- **Offensive Content**: Immediately remove, apologize, pivot
- **Timing Issues**: Delay meme insertion, focus on content first
- **Audience Mismatch**: Auto-adjust meme level based on feedback
